**[opentax.filed.com](https://opentax.filed.com)** - Fully open-source federal tax calculation engine. Single binary. Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

> **Note:** This engine calculates taxes accurately for use by AI agents and developers. For filing your taxes, visit [irs.gov](https://irs.gov).

Built and maintained by AI agents using official IRS publications as the sole source of truth.

> Covers Form 1040 (TY2025) today. Additional forms and state returns coming.

## Why

- Professional tax software is closed source and expensive to maintain. Every rule change required manual updates to the codebase
- AI agents have drastically reduced the cost of building and maintaining tax software. It only makes sense to do it in the open
- This project aims to be the first truly open-source, up-to-date tax calculation engine that works for everyone

**Designed for the AI era:**

- Built to be run by AI agents more than humans
- Single binary CLI that AI agents can download and run instantly
- Everything stored locally. Open, secure, and accessible

Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch), an autonomous loop where AI agents modify code, measure results, and keep only improvements. OpenTax applies the same idea to tax calculation: agents read IRS instructions, write implementations, generate test cases, and fix regressions in a continuous loop.

## Example: single W-2 filer

```bash
$ opentax return create --year 2025
{ "returnId": "a1b2c3" }

$ opentax form add --returnId a1b2c3 --node_type general '{"filing_status": "single"}'
{ "id": "general_01", "nodeType": "general" }

$ opentax form add --returnId a1b2c3 --node_type w2 '{"box1_wages": 55000, "box2_fed_withheld": 5200}'
{ "id": "w2_01", "nodeType": "w2" }

$ opentax return get --returnId a1b2c3
```

```json
{
  "returnId": "a1b2c3",
  "year": 2025,
  "summary": {
    "line1z_total_wages": 55000,
    "line9_total_income": 55000,
    "line11_agi": 55000,
    "line15_taxable_income": 39250,
    "line24_total_tax": 4471.5,
    "line33_total_payments": 5200,
    "line35a_refund": 728.5
  },
  "lines": {
    "filing_status": "single",
    "line1a_wages": 55000,
    "line12a_standard_deduction": 15750,
    "line15_taxable_income": 39250,
    "line16_income_tax": 4471.5,
    "line24_total_tax": 4471.5,
    "line25a_w2_withheld": 5200,
    "line33_total_payments": 5200,
    "line34_overpayment": 728.5,
    "line35a_refund": 728.5
  }
}
```

$55,000 in wages, $15,750 standard deduction, $39,250 taxable income, $4,471.50 tax, $728.50 refund. Every line traces back to the IRS instructions.

## More commands

```bash
# Validate against IRS MeF business rules
opentax return validate --returnId a1b2c3

# Export as IRS MeF XML (ready for e-file)
opentax return export --returnId a1b2c3 --type mef > return.xml

# List entries in a return
opentax form list --returnId a1b2c3

# Update or delete a form entry
opentax form update --returnId a1b2c3 --entryId w2_01 '{"box1_wages": 60000, "box2_fed_withheld": 5800}'
opentax form delete --returnId a1b2c3 --entryId w2_01

# Inspect what fields a node expects
opentax node inspect --node_type w2

# List all registered nodes
opentax node list
```

---

## Staying up to date

OpenTax tells you when a new version is available:

```
$ opentax return get --returnId abc-123
{ ... }

Update available: 0.1.0 → 0.2.0. Run `opentax update` to upgrade.
```

To update:

```bash
opentax update
```

That's it. The binary replaces itself with the latest release.

Check your current version anytime:

```bash
opentax version
```

## Supported forms (TY2025)

131 input nodes covering the full range of 1040 source documents: W-2s, 1099s, all major schedules, credits, capital transactions, and more.

See [`catalog.ts`](catalog.ts) for the complete list of supported nodes and their schemas. Or from the CLI:

```bash
opentax node list
```

---

## How it's built

The engine is a directed graph of **nodes**. Each node is a pure function: validated input in, typed output out. No state, no side effects.

- Schemas defined with Zod, types inferred (never duplicated)
- Immutable data throughout, no mutation anywhere
- Type-safe output routing between nodes enforced at compile time
- 133 real-world benchmark scenarios

AI agents maintain the codebase:

- Read IRS instructions
- Write node implementations
- Generate test cases from official IRS exercises
- Fix regressions

All traced back to the authoritative IRS source.

## Development

Requires [Deno](https://deno.land).

```bash
# Run tests
deno task test

# Run accuracy benchmark
deno task bench

# Run the CLI in dev mode
deno task tax return create --year 2025
```

### Contributing with Claude Code

The repo includes four skills that automate the full development lifecycle. Open the project in [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and invoke them with `/skill-name`.

#### `/tax-status`

Run this first. Shows pass/fail counts, pending root causes, and build phase for every form.

```
/tax-status
```

#### `/tax-fix [form:year]`

Autonomous bug-fixing loop. Reads failing benchmark cases, clusters them by root cause, spawns parallel fixer agents, validates, and commits any net-positive improvements. Loops until all cases pass or progress stalls.

```
/tax-fix f1040:2025
```

#### `/tax-cases [source]`

Sources test cases from IRS publications (VITA exercises, Pub 17, MeF test packages). Run `/tax-fix` after to see how the engine performs on the new cases.

```
/tax-cases vita                            # VITA Pub 4491 training exercises
/tax-cases pub17                           # Publication 17 worked examples
/tax-cases "senior with SSA and 1099-R"    # free-form scenario
```

#### `/tax-build [form-number]`

End-to-end form builder. Researches IRS instructions, extracts ground truth, builds all nodes section by section, then runs a validate + fix loop until >= 95% of benchmark cases pass. Resumes if interrupted.

```
/tax-build 1120
```

#### Typical workflows

**Adding a new form:**

```
/tax-cases f1120:2025 vita    # source benchmark cases first
/tax-build 1120               # build nodes, iterate until >= 95% pass
/tax-status                   # confirm it's green
```

**Fixing a regression:**

```
/tax-status                   # find what's failing and why
/tax-fix f1040:2025           # autonomous fix loop
```

**Expanding test coverage:**

```
/tax-cases pub17              # pull new IRS examples
/tax-fix f1040:2025           # fix loop against expanded case set
```
